# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
It uses ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer to detect the head posture of the user to determine whether the driver is feeling drowsy or not.
If the user's head tilts downwards to a certain degree then the buzzer which is positioned near the user's ear will start beeping in order to wake up the user avoiding the possible accident.It also has a IR sensor to determine whether the user is wearing the cap or not ,this is done in order to avoide any false triggers.
